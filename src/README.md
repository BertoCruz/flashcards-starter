## Abstract
initially, this Flash Card game is partially built and requires the student to complete it according the the specifications of the assignment:
* We must follow the project spec/propmts to make a working application
* We must implement ES6 classes
* We must write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* We must implement a robust testing suite using TDD

The Flash Card game is to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round. This Project will allow the student to grow habits in implementing strong SRP practices, as well as building a strong undderstanding in TDD to drive implementation in our code.
